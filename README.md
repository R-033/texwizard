# Texture Wizard

Simple script that allows you to easily replace any texture. It supports following titles:
- NFS Underground
- NFS Underground 2
- NFS Most Wanted
- NFS Carbon
- NFS ProStreet
- NFS Undercover

Thanks to nlgxzef for adding support for most of these games.

The main purpose of this script is to be a more stable alternative to TexMod. It allows to easily change any textures in the game (including world textures) without overwriting any game files or introducing any instability. Multiple packs can be used at once in a single game installation and can be removed without the need for a backup.

It works by forcing the game to load additional global files that contain new textures and then just pointing the game to use these new textures instead of the old ones via name substitution. This means it doesn't perform any VRAM manipulation or similar techniques that would cause instability or slowdowns.

Compiled .asi script and an example pack are included in <a href=https://github.com/R-033/texwizard/releases>releases</a>.
