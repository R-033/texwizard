# Texture Wizard

Simple script that allows you to easily replace any texture. Initially supported only MW, later was expanded by nlgxzef and now supports following titles:
- NFS Underground
- NFS Underground 2
- NFS Most Wanted
- NFS Carbon
- NFS ProStreet
- NFS Undercover

The main purpose of this script is to be a more stable alternative to TexMod. It works similar to texture packs in Minecraft - each "pack" contains it's own textures and a list of bindings to replace existing textures. Multiple packs can be used at once in a single game installation.

Compiled .asi script and an example pack are included in <a href=https://github.com/R-033/texwizard/releases>releases</a>.
