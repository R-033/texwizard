# Texture Wizard

Simple script that allows you to easily replace any texture in NFS Most Wanted and Carbon. It was initially made for elaymm4 to use in his mods, but you're free to use it as well.

The main purpose of this script is to be a more stable alternative to TexMod. It works similar to texture packs in Minecraft - each "pack" contains it's own textures and a list of bindings to replace existing textures. Multiple packs can be used at once in a single game installation.

Compiled .asi script and an example pack are included in <a href=https://github.com/R-033/texwizard/releases>releases</a>.

For usage refer to <a href=https://github.com/R-033/texwizard/wiki>wiki</a>.
